# diploma\_thesis

This repository contains the LaTeX-code of my diploma thesis "Galois-Groups of relative Frobenius-Modules" (original German title: "Galoisgruppen von relativen Frbenius-Moduln") submitted in January 2011 at Heidelberg University.
There are some mild updates compared to the original version due to some LaTeX-packages being outdated in the meantime, moving the bibliography from BibTex to BibLaTeX and biber and splitting the document in several sub-documents.
